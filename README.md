# Important update
Guys who was building this awesome software decided to go on proprietary path to auth0 solution.
I don't know a lot about authentification, but its a shame not to able to build software without pain for startups and small companies. We already have overpriced solution for enterprise, and I think we don't need another one.

So, I decided to fork the repo and at least try to update it to .NET6 myself. Don't know if I'll be able to do this, but at least I try. I want the .NET be the best platform for webdev, and now we're losing the war.

Original repo is [there](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4)
